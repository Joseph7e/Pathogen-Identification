# Potential-Pathogen-Identification


 So now that's finished we are about to work on the manuscript of potential pathogen detection that you helped me out with last spring. Basically I'm at the point of trying to pull everything together and needed the scripts that you wrote. I think you at least wrote a couple, I'll list ones I think you wrote:
 
 
 (1) script to blast fasta files against potential pathogen database and I think it outputted the stats as well
 (2) script to extract the 16S sequences from genomes 
 (3) the location of the potential pathogen 16S database
 (4) Anything else you might have related to this work.

Let me know if you have these still!

Your contributions definitely are worth acknowledgements and I think they would warrant authorship if you were interested in reviewing the manuscript. I'll make sure Steveo agrees with that too though.

Thanks again for your help on this and be on the lookout for the metabarcode paper hopefully soon.
